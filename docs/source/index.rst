QuantEcon documentation
=======================

The `quantecon` python library consists of a number of modules which
includes economic models (models), markov chains (markov), random 
generation utilities (random), a collection of tools (tools), 
and other utilities (util) which are 
mainly used by developers internal to the package. 

The models section, for example, contains implementations of standard
models, many of which are discussed in lectures on the website `quant-
econ.net <http://quant-econ.net>`_.
